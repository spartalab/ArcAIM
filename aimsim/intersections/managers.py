"""
This module contains several intersection priority managers based on different
policies.

The manager itself handles whether reservations are requested and the order in
which reservations are allocated. Once a reservation has been accepted,
continued maintenance of requests before their completion is handed off to the
tiling (which is owned by the manager).
